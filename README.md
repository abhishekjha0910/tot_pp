Important Notes
The API endpoint (https://freetestapi.com/api/v1/dogs) must be active and accessible

Location features require physical device testing

Google Maps integration needs proper coordinate data in dog objects

**Future Improvements**
* Add proper data models for type safety
* 
* Implement state management (e.g., Provider/Riverpod)
* 
* Add image caching for network images
* 
* Include pull-to-refresh functionality
* 
* Add unit/widget tests
